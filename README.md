# Multi-classification practice
This is the first multi-classification model I created,which effectively separates data into suitable categories with non-linearity with the help of the softmax activation function.

## Note:
+ This code was originally written on .ipynb
+ This indicates how I learned my first Classification problem, utilizing Linear and Non-linear models.
