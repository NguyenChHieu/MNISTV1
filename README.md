# MNISTV1
MNISTV2 is the first convolutional neural network I created to represent the TinyVGG model of https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/

## Note:
+ This code was originally written on .ipynb
+ This indicates how I learned my first Classification problem, utilizing Linear and Non-linear models.
